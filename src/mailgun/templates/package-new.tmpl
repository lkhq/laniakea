Subject: [{{repo}}] {{upload_name}} for {{suite_name}} is NEW

Your package has been put into the NEW queue, which means it will require
a human review to proceed further.
The upload was otherwise valid (it had a good OpenPGP signature and file
hashes are valid), so please be patient.

Packages are routinely processed through to the archive, and do feel
free to browse the NEW queue[1].

If there is an issue with the upload, you will receive an email from a
member of the review team.
